# Mrml::Rails

`mrml-rails` is a ActionMailer templating engine that uses the Rust-based MRML compiler in order to compile MJML files into pure HTML.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mrml-rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mrml-rails

## Usage

All you need to do is to have the file extension `mjml` on the specific views.

I.e.: `sign_up.html.mjml`, `sign_up.mjml`
